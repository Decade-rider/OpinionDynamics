# OpinionDynamics
The repository contains all the code that was used to create the plots for the report

## Hegselmann-Krause models
Code available in `HK.ipynb`
- _Figure 1.1:_ some basic sample simulations
- Hegselmann-Krause model (HK.ipynb): symmetric, fixed asymmetry, opinion dependent asymmetry
- ODE model (ODE.ipynb): analysis of averaging, symmetric, fixed asymmetry, opinion dependent asymmetry
- SDE model (SDE.ipynb): symmetric, fixed asymmetry
- PDE model (PDE.ipynb): symmetric, fixed asymmetry

Some of the code takes a while to run and is therefore commented out. The corresponding results of the code that is commented out can be found in the `savedResults` directory.
